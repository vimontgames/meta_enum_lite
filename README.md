# Meta Enum Lite 2.0 - Static reflection on enums in C++17

## Brief

I adapted [Meta Enum](https://github.com/therocode/meta_enum) for the needs of [vgframework](https://github.com/vimontgames/vgframework) 
with the following goals:

- More template-friendly (but still LLVM-compatible ;))
- Faster compilation times

## History

In my pet engine project, [vgframework](https://github.com/vimontgames/vgframework), I was initially using 
[magic_enum](https://github.com/Neargye/magic_enum) until I realized my program was compiling more than **twice** as fast if I removed 
magic_enum (36s vs 1m16s).

So I was looking for an alternative solution, and amongst others I found meta_enum but I wanted to be able use templates to retrieve
enum reflection data like this:

``` debugPrint("MyEnum::A = \"%s\"\n", getEnumString(test::MyEnum::A).c_str()); ```

## More template-friendly

Compared to original meta_enum, the macro now also declares a traits struct so that we can get the *enum*_meta from enum typename.
In order to be compatible with LLVM that requires the template specialization traits to be declared at global scope, 
enums defined in namespaces needs to pass the namespace as argument so that the macro can temporarily "exit" the name space to declare the traits. 
Only one level of fully qualified namespace names is supported.

## Usage

### Declare `enum MyEnumXYZ` in namespace `test`
``` 
namespace test
{
    vg_enum(test, MyEnumABC,
        X = 0,
        Y = 1,
        Z = 2
    );
}
``` 

### Declare `enum class MyEnumABC : uint` in namespace `test`
``` 
namespace test
{
    vg_enum_class(test, MyEnumABC,
        uint,
        A = 65,
        B = 66,
        C = 67
    );
}
``` 

### Declare `enum MyEnumUVW` at global scope
``` 
namespace test
{
    vg_enum_global(test, MyEnumUVW,
        U = 0,
        V = 1,
        W = 2
    );
}
``` 

### Declare `enum class MyEnumRGBA : short` at global scope
``` 
namespace test
{
    vg_enum_class_global(test, MyEnumRGBA,
        short,
        R = 0x000F,
        G = 0x00F0,
        B = 0x0F00,
        A = 0xF000
    );
}
``` 

Then to get metadata object associated to an enum type we just need to use
```
MetaEnumTraits<Type>::Meta
```

This way, it's possible to implement functions that does not require to specify the meta object name.

### getEnumString
Returns a std::string with the label of an enum value.

``` 
MyEnumABC enumValue = MyEnumABC::C;
[...]
string label = getEnumString(enumValue);
``` 

### getEnumCString
Returns a const char * with the label of an enum value.
``` 
MyEnumABC enumValue = MyEnumABC::C;
[...]
const char * label = getEnumCString(enumValue);
``` 

### getEnumValue
Returns the enum value at index *n*
```
getEnumValue<MyEnumABC>(0);
```

### enumCount
``` 
const auto count = enumCount<MyEnumABC>();
``` 
Returns the number of elements declared in the enum.

## Faster compilation times

Once I replaced magic_enum with meta_enum, compilation times went down from **1m17s** to **56s**. Not bad, but still far from **36s**.
So I removed #includes to <array> and <string_view> from the header and used minimal containers mimicing the same features instead.

I also removed a lot of funcs that we generated from the macro to replace them with the template versions that are instanciated 
when the code actually used them.

Compilation times were now down to **42s** for DX12 debug build, on a 7800X3D CPU

| Enum reflection  | Total compile time | Delta
| ---------------- | -------------------| ------------------------------------------
| Disabled         | 36s                | -
| magic_enum       | 77s                | +113%
| meta_enum        | 56s                | +55%
| meta_enum_lite   | 42s                | +16%

# Meta Enum - Static reflection on enums in C++17

## Brief

Single-header facility for compile time reflection of enums in C++17.

### Features
 * Automatic string conversion of enum entries
 * Tracking of enum size - i.e. member count
 * Look up enum entries by index
 * Convenience functions for converting between all of the above
 * Supports both enum and enum class
 * Supports enums nested in types/namespaces/functions
 * Keeps track of the C++ code used to declare the enums
 * Single header standard C++17 magic.

### Compiled Example
See compiled code at: https://godbolt.org/z/TaPqPa

### Tested On
 * gcc 7.3 - works
 * gcc 8.1 - works
 * gcc 8.2 - works
 * clang 6.0 - works - however broken with current stdlib version on godbolt's compiler explorer
 * MSVC pre 2018 (version on godbolt's compiler explorer) - works for typical case, not for complex enum test case

## Installation

Either make sure the `meta_enum.hpp` file is made available in your include paths or just copy it to your project.

## Usage

```cpp
#include <meta_enum.hpp>
```

### Declaring Enums

Use the macro `meta_enum` to declare your enums.

```cpp
meta_enum(Days, int, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday);
//equivalent to:
//enum Days : int { Monday, ...
```

Or use `meta_enum_class` for enum class.

The `meta_enum` macro supports assigning custom values to entries as per usual.
```cpp
meta_enum(MyEnum, uint8_t, First = 0, Second = 1 << 5, Third = myConstexprFunction<int>());
```

### Meta Enum Objects

By using `meta_enum` to declare `MyEnum`, you get the global constexpr object `MyEnum_meta` which stores a representation of your enum and is of type `MetaEnum`.

#### MetaEnum type - contains data for the whole enum declaration and holds all members

Typedefs:
 * UnderlyingType - contains the selected underlying integer type for the enum

Members:
 * string - contains the full enum declaration as a `string_view`
 * members - contains representations of all enum members represented as an std::array with MetaEnumMember objects

#### MetaEnumMember type - contains data for one particular enum member

Members:
 * value - The enum value, for example `MyEnum::Second`
 * name - String representation of the member. For example `"Second"`
 * string - The whole declaration string. For example `" Second = 1 << 5"`
 * index - The numerical index of this member. For example `1`

### Convenience functions

A few functions are provided per `meta_enum` to ease usage.

For an enum with the name `MyEnum` you will get the following:
 * `std::string_view MyEnum_value_to_string(MyEnum)` converts an enum value to a textual representation. Will use the `.name` member of the member, or `"__INVALID_ENUM_VAL__"` on invalid input.
 * `std::optional<MetaEnumMember> MyEnum_meta_from_name(std::string_view)` Accesses the meta object for a member found by name. Returns nullopt on invalid input.
 * `std::optional<MetaEnumMember> MyEnum_meta_from_value(MyEnum)` Accesses the meta object for a member found by enum value. Returns nullopt on invalid input.
 * `std::optional<MetaEnumMember> MyEnum_meta_from_index(std::string_view)` Accesses the meta object for a member found by enum member index. Returns nullopt on invalid input.

## Examples

See the file in the repo `examples.cpp`

## Problems and limitations

### Build errors

Some configurations of certain compilers seem to break down when building this. Specifically there is a problem with clang 6.0 on godbolt which fails to build due to what looks like problems with `std::string_view` not being constexpr even though it should be. See: https://godbolt.org/z/Ob9Cnv
There has also been problems when building with the MSVC Pre 2018 hosted @godbolt.org as well when it builds with the complex test case inside of example.cpp. It works however for the typical case. See: https://godbolt.org/z/rIhpfR

### Enum parsing problems with nested templates

`meta_enum` uses string parsing to be able to extract the names of each enum entry. This string parsing takes into account that enum declarations can contain pretty complex meta-programming expressions - it's not as simple as counting commas. The algorithm for doing so is somewhat naive and cannot tell apart `>>` as the operator and `>>` as the end of two nested templates (`std::vector<std::vector<int>> for example`). Due to this, nested template angle brackets have to be separated by whitespace, i.e. `>>` has to be `> >`.
